## Summary

A virtual simulation of a life-sized augmented reality experience about a generated conversation between heaven and hell.

## Simultaneous Realities

This project is made for an assignment during the minor Extended Reality on HKU (Academy of Art Utrecht). We've been commissioned to create an experience for an ultra-large double-sided augmented reality screen that rotates on its axis. To showcase a proof of concept and further develop this concept, we virtualised our idea in this unity project.
